#Training-A-Reinforcement-Neural-Network

Flag-It-AI-Game

This project is still definitely IN PROGRESS:

- I have written the game and reinforcement learning algorithm from scratch
- However the AI currently starts of well (note there are biases towards flags) but soon learns bad habits and ceases to improve, instead only reinforcing undesired traits. (eg: moving towards bottom right or bottom left regardless of where the flags are).
