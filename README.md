Training-A-Reinforcement-Neural-Network

The aim for this project is to train my reinforcement neural network to plag Flag Run, an arcade game I designed last year.

This project is still IN PROGRESS:

- I have written the game and reinforcement learning algorithm from scratch
- However whilst the AI currently starts off well (note there are biases towards flags), it soon learns bad habits and ceases to improve, instead only reinforcing undesired traits. (eg: moving towards bottom right or bottom left regardless of where the flags are).
